# Weapon Detection and Notification System

## Overview
This project is a Weapon Detection and Notification System designed to enhance security by detecting weapons in real-time using AI and notifying the relevant authorities. The system employs the YOLOv8 (You Only Look Once) model for weapon detection and leverages cloud servers and SMS messaging for remote monitoring and instant notifications.

## Features
- **Weapon Detection**: Utilizes the YOLOv8 model to accurately detect weapons in real-time.
- **Realtime Monitoring**: Monitors video feeds in real-time and processes them on a cloud server.
- **Notification System**: Sends instant notifications via SMS to designated recipients when a weapon is detected.
- **GPU Acceleration**: The system is optimized for GPU acceleration to ensure fast and efficient processing.

## Current Status
The system is currently under development. Key functionalities like weapon detection, real-time monitoring, and the notification system are being actively worked on to ensure robustness and reliability.

## Requirements
- **YOLOv8 Model**: For weapon detection.
- **Cloud Server**: To handle video processing and monitoring remotely.
- **SMS Gateway**: For sending instant notifications.
- **GPU Support**: To accelerate the detection process.

## Usage
1. **Run the application**:
    ```bash
    python main.py
    ```
2. **Monitor the system**:
    - Access the real-time monitoring dashboard via the provided cloud server URL.
    - Receive SMS notifications for detected weapons.

## Future Enhancements
- Improve the accuracy and efficiency of the YOLOv8 model.
- Integrate additional notification channels (e.g., email, push notifications).
- Implement a comprehensive user interface for easier monitoring and management.
